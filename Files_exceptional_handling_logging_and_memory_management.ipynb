        "# Theoritical  questions\n",
        "\n",
        "1. What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages?\n",
        "  ->Interpreted: Code runs line-by-line (example - Python).\n",
        "  Compiled: Code is translated to machine code before execution (example - C++).\n",
        "  Interpreted languages are slower but easier to debug. compiled ones are faster.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.What is exception handling in Python?\n",
        "  ->Exception handling allows us to catch and respond to errors during program execution using try, except, else, and finally. in try block we write the code which might give error and in exception block we handle the error.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?\n",
        "  ->The finally block runs whether an exception is raised or not. It’s typically used to clean up resources. for example closing the file.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.What is logging in Python?\n",
        "  ->Logging is the process of recording program events and errors. Python’s logging module helps us log messages at different  levels like DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, and CRITICAL.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "  ->The __del__ method is called when an object is about to be destroyed. It can be used to release resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "6.What is the difference between import and from ... import in Python?\n",
        "  ->import module: imports the whole module.\n",
        "    from module import func: imports only the specified function or class.\n",
        "\n",
        "7.How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python?\n",
        "  ->Use multiple except blocks or a single except with a tuple.\n",
        "   try:\n",
        "        ## here i can write my suspected code\n",
        "    except (TypeError,ValueError)n as e:\n",
        "      ## print(\"the error is\",e)\n",
        "\n",
        "8.What is the purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python?\n",
        "  ->It ensures proper resource management. Files opened using with are automatically closed, even if an error occurs.\n",
        "    code:-\n",
        "        with open(\"file.txt\",r) as file:\n",
        "            data = file.read()\n",
        "        print(data) ## here print the file data\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing?\n",
        "  ->Multithreading: multiple threads run in the same memory space. Multiple processes runs concurrently in multiple threads..\n",
        "  Multiprocessing: Separate processes with separate memory.Multiple processes runs in parallelly in multiple processor.\n",
        "\n",
        "10.What are the advantages of using logging in a program?\n",
        "  ->Tracks events and errors.\n",
        "  Helps debug issues.\n",
        "  Offers different log levels.\n",
        "  Works better than print() in large applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is memory management in Python?\n",
        "  ->Memory management in Python refers to how Python allocates and deallocates memory to store variables, data structures, and objects during program execution.Python manages memory automatically using reference counting.\n",
        "\n",
        "12.What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python?\n",
        "  ->try – Code that may raise an error.\n",
        "  except – Handle the error.\n",
        "  else – Runs if no exception occurs.\n",
        "  finally – Runs everytime , no matter error occured or not.\n",
        "\n",
        "13.Why is memory management important in Python?\n",
        "  ->It ensures efficient use of memory, prevents leaks, and maintains program stability and performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "14.What is the role of try and except in exception handling?\n",
        "  ->try – Code that may raise an error.\n",

        "\n",
        "15.How does Python's garbage collection system work?\n",
        "  ->It uses reference counting and a cyclic garbage collector to detect and clean up unused objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "16.What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling?\n",
        "  ->The else block runs only if no exception occurs in the try block. It’s used for code that should run when the try is successful.\n",
        "\n",
        "17.What are the common logging levels in Python?\n",
        "  ->DEBUG\n",
        "    INFO\n",
        "    WARNING\n",
        "    ERROR\n",
        "    CRITICAL\n",
        "\n",
        "18.What is the difference between os.fork() and multiprocessing in Python?\n",
        "  ->os.fork() is unix-only and creates a child process.\n",
        "    multiprocessing is cross-platform and provides an easier interface for\n",
        "    spawning processes.\n",
        "\n",
        "19.What is the importance of closing a file in Python?\n",
        "  ->It ensures all data is saved, frees system resources, and prevents data corruption or file locks.\n",
        "\n",
        "20.What is the difference between file.read() and file.readline() in Python?\n",
        "  ->read(): Reads the whole file, whole content in the file.\n",
        "  readline(): Reads one line at a time\n",
        "\n",
        "21.What is the logging module in Python used for?\n",
        "  ->To record logs of events, errors, and informational messages during program execution.\n",
        "\n",
        "22.What is the os module in Python used for in file handling?\n",
        "  ->Used to interact with the operating system.like navigating directories, checking file existence, or removing files.\n",
        "\n",
        "23.What are the challenges associated with memory management in Python?\n",
        "  ->Managing cyclic references.\n",
